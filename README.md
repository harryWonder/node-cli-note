### Node Cli Note

This is a mini project I built to help you create Note, list Note, and delete Note.

### Installation Options

Please, try the following steps to have the app installed on your computer.

1. Run **npm install** from your terminal.

This is the only steps you need to run. After running this command, you can also run the following command to get the app running.

1. Run **node app.js --help**: This will give you a list of commands you can execute for adding notes, listing notes, fetching notes and deleting notes.
